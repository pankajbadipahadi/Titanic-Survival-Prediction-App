# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction App  

A **machine learning web application** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that predicts whether a Titanic passenger would survive, based on their details.  
The model behind the app is a **Logistic Regression classifier** trained on the famous [Titanic dataset].

## ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… User-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit  
âœ… Real-time predictions of survival probability  
âœ… Encodes categorical inputs automatically (`Sex`, `Embarked`)  
âœ… Can run **locally** with Anaconda or be **deployed online** with Streamlit Cloud  
âœ… Modular design â€“ you can replace the model with any `.pkl` file trained on the same features

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model
The model was trained using **Logistic Regression** with `scikit-learn`.  

### Features used for training:
- `Pclass` â€“ Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- `Sex` â€“ Male/Female  
- `Age` â€“ Passenger age  
- `SibSp` â€“ Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- `Parch` â€“ Number of parents/children aboard  
- `Fare` â€“ Ticket fare  
- `Embarked` â€“ Port of Embarkation (`C`, `Q`, `S`)  

Categorical features were encoded using **OneHotEncoder / pd.get_dummies** before training.  
The model outputs:  
- **0 â†’ Not Survive**  
- **1 â†’ Survive**
